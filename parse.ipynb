All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are expected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the ODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants (university, colleges, public libraries and schools).\n",

During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions:\n",

A budget of this nature will ensure a core digital collection of sufficient scope and coverage to address a substantial amount of the wide and diverse information and learning needs of the citizens of Ontario (an overview of the nature of the ODL digital collection is appended). The proposed ODL expenditures in 2006 represent an investment of $5.00 per citizen.\n",

This multiplier means that for every dollar invested in ODL the return on investment is worth $2 of value for Ontario.\n",
